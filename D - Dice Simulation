Dice Simulation
Problem Description
We know that a fair S-sided dice would show up one of the numbers 1 through S with equal probability (1/S) at each throw. We also know that a fair coin (a two-sided dice!) would show up heads and tails with equal probability (0.5) at each toss.

Note: We may assume that a 2-sided dice (coin) is numbered 1 on a side and 2 on the other.

Let's play the following game using different-sided dices:

1) Throw a fair S-sided dice and note the number S1 shown. S1 would be a natural number in the closed interval [1, S].

2) If S1 is 1, stop, else throw a fair S1-sided dice and note the number S2 shown. S2 would be a natural number in [1, S1].

3) If S2 is 1, stop, else throw a fair S2-sided dice. S2 would be in [1, S2].

Repeat in the above fashion, stopping if the previous throw is 1 or throwing a dice with a number of sides equal to the previous throw.

Given number S and starting with step 1, what the expected number of dice throws in one play?

Write a program to accept S, run a simulation of the game 10000 times and note the expected number of dice throws, averaging the number over the number of simulations. The average may be rounded off. Repeat the set of 10000 runs 9 more times and note the average numbers of dice throws in a game. Print the minimum of the rounded averages obtained from the 10 sets of simulations.
