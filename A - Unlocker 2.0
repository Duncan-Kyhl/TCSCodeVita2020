Unlocker 2.0
Problem Description
Consider a M * N grid of numbers. This grid represents a locked matrix. You are also given a set S which has K integers. This set S is termed as Unlocking Set.

If S can be discovered in a specific fashion inside the grid then the grid can be unlocked, else it is not possible to unlock the grid.

The k values in the Set S determine the dimension of a sub-matrix. Let's call it Unlocking sub-matrix. Unlocking sub-matrix is square matrix contained entirely inside the larger grid of dimension M * N. Presence of this sub-matrix in the grid determines if the larger grid is unlockable. Your task is to find this unlocking sub-matrix in the larger grid.

The hard part about unlocking is that this Unlocking sub-matrix can be any permutation of the K elements in the set S. The rules that govern the dimensions of the sub-matrix are as follows

It is a square matrix

Each dimension is squareroot of K i.e. Math.sqrt(K)

It is also guaranteed that all values in the unlocking set S have distinct values. Refer example section to understand more about the role of permutations in the whole scheme of things.

Constraints
0 <= M, N < 250

0 <= K < M*N

Input
First line contains two space separated integer M and N which is number of rows and number of columns in grid

Next M lines contains N space separated integers which represent M * N grid

Next Line contains an Integer K which is size of set S

Next line contains K space separated integers which set of decoding values

Output
If this puzzle contains this sub matrix print "Possible" else print "Not Possible".

9

56 34 36 55 35 44 45 46 54

Output

Possible

Explanation:

Dimensions of Unlocking sub-matrix will be Math.sqrt(9) which is 3 * 3

We can see that one permutation of this set exist as sub-matrix of size 3 * 3 in larger grid of 6 * 6

1 2 3 4 5 6

11 12 13 14 15 16

21 22 23 24 25 26

31 32 33 36 35 34

41 42 43 44 45 46

51 52 53 54 55 56

So, output will be "Possible"

Output

Not Possible

Explanation:

Dimensions of Unlocking sub-matrix will be Math.sqrt(9) which is 3 * 3

We can see that no permutation of 9 values in set S exist as a sub-matrix of size 3 * 3 in this matrix.

1 2 3 4 5 6

11 12 13 14 15 16

31 32 33 36 35 34

41 42 43 44 45 46

51 52 53 54 55 56

So, output will be "Not Possible".
